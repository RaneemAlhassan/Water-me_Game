# Water-me_Game
This is my first game using java,java swing and illustrator for desings, I've been working on it for the past week with my creative colleague Yaser Harba. The game is basically all about a plant that needs to be watered, and you'd have to do so by connecting a number of tubes with each other to create a path from a water tank to the plant without exceeding a certain number of movements.
